# Food-With-Friends

Design decisions evolved through an iterative process. The initial step involved creating low-fidelity prototypes individually to explore design possibilities and affordances for users. Group design inspection, based on Nielsen's usability heuristics, led to the identification of necessary pages for the three main features. Each page was then designed with specific usability principles in mind, such as flexibility, efficiency, recognition rather than recall, and error prevention.

The high-fidelity prototype was created using Figma and tested with five users, who were given tasks to complete. Key takeaways from the testing included the need to include error messages, account for the different paths users may take in accomplishing a task and help users feel less overwhelmed with the preference form. Unique user needs, like blocking individuals or creating groups of close friends, were also considered as future improvements for the website.

The final product shifted from an application to a website format while maintaining it design strengths.The website incorporates unique features including a playful and welcoming mood, a navigation bar for efficient navigation of the website, UX writing for clear communication, and a preference form for customizable meal plans. 

By testing our final product with a total of 8 users from a convenience sample, we find that most users describe our design as friendly, intuitive and effortless, all of which are qualities we strive for during the design process. We also use A/B testing to find a way to prevent users from feeling overwhelmed with the options on the preference form page. Eventually, we found that making the form more spaced-out and staggered with center alignment of the text help users feel less overwhelmed and fits with our playful mood and tone. Thus, we change the form design accordingly.

Overall, the design decisions were influenced by user feedback, usability principles, and the need for a community-oriented experience, resulting in a refined and user-centered interface.
